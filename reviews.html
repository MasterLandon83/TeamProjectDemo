                    Blue Lightning is a refreshing and delicious sports drink that is perfect for those who lead active lifestyles and like to party. 
                    Not only does it provide hydration and energy for my workouts. 
                    If you're looking for a drink that can do both, then Blue Lightning is the perfect choice for you.

                    This is at least 3 times more hydrating than Gatorade, its refreshing, NOT as Sugary/too Sweet, and it's better than the packet fruit-Flavored electrolyte powder you may have tried in the past. It's not as salty as some alternatives.
